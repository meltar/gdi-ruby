            <p>A <strong>boolean</strong> is a basic data type.</p>
            <p>It can have only two values: <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>
                <p>Code that compares values and returns True or False is called a <strong>Boolean expression</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test for equality by using '=='. We can't use '=' because that is used for assignment</li>
                    <li>Test for greater than and less than using '&gt;' and '&lt;'</li>

                <h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>
                <p>A boolean expression evaluates to true or false. It can also have multiple parts, joined by '&&' (and) or '||' (or).</p>

            <h3>Let's Develop It</h3>
            <p>Take a few minutes and experiment with boolean expressions in IRB. You can start with the examples below.</p>
            <pre><code class="ruby">
true && false
1 == 1 && 2 > 37
"boop" == "bip" || 7 == 8
false || true 
89 > 88 || 89 < 90
true || !(1 == 1 || 2 == 65)
            </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Putting Booleans to Work</h3>
              <p>So, what's the value of knowing if a statement is true or false? Often, you'll use that to control whether a piece of code will execute or not.</p>

              <pre><code  class="ruby">
user_guess = gets.chomp.to_i
secret_number = 312

if user_guess < secret_number 
  puts "Too low!"
elsif user_guess > secret_number
  puts "Too high!"
else 
  puts "You guessed it. Wow maybe you're psychic...."
end 
            </code></pre>
            <p>Can you tell what this code does?</p>
          </section>                  

            <section>
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p>When we want different code to execute depending on certain criteria, we use a <strong>conditional</strong></p>
                <p>We achieve this using <strong>if</strong> statements and boolean expressions.</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
if x == 5
  puts 'x is equal to 5'
end

puts 'x is equal to 5' if x == 5
                </code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p>We often want a different block to execute if the statement is false. This can be accomplished using <strong>else</strong>.</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
if x == 5
  puts 'x is equal to 5'
else
  puts 'x is not equal to 5'
end
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p>The following shows some examples of conditionals with more complex boolean expressions:</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
# And
if x > 3 && y > 3
  puts 'Both values are greater than 3'
end

# Or 
if x != 0 || y != 0
  puts 'The point x,y is not on the x or y axis'
end
            </code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p>The following shows some examples of conditionals with more complex boolean expressions:</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
# Not
if !(x > y)
  puts 'x is less than y'
end

puts 'x is less than y' if !(x > y)

puts 'x is less than y' unless x > y
            </code></pre>
            <p>The parentheses allow us to group expressions and negate them.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Chained conditionals</h3>
                <p>Conditionals can also be <strong>chained</strong>.</p>
                <p>Chained conditionals use <strong>elsif</strong> to test if additional statements are true. The single 'else' action will only happen if all preceding conditions are false.</p>

                <p>For example:</p>
                <pre><code class="ruby">
if x > 10
  puts "x is greater than 10"
elsif x <= 10 && x > 0
  puts "x is a number between 1 and 10"
else
  puts "Wow, don't be so negative!"
end
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>It is often useful to perform a task and to repeat the process until a certain point is reached.</p>
                <p>The repeated execution of a set of statements is called <strong>iteration</strong>, or (more commonly) a loop.</p>
                <p>One way to achieve this is with the <strong>while</strong> loop.</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
x = 10

while x > 0
  puts "Loop number #{x}"
  x = x - 1
end 

puts 'Done'
                </code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>While Loops</h3>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
x = 10

while x > 0
  puts "Loop number #{x}"
  x = x - 1
end 
                </code></pre>
            <p>The while statement takes a condition, and as long as it evaluates to true, the code block beneath it is repeated. This creates a <strong>loop</strong>.</p>
            <p> Without the 'x = x - 1' statement to decrement the value of x, this would be an <strong>infinite loop!</strong></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>While loops</h3>
                <p>Consider the following example that uses a while loop to sing you a song.</p>
                <pre><code class="ruby">
num_bottles = 99

while num_bottles > 0
  puts "#{num_bottles} bottles of beer on the wall, 
  #{num_bottles} bottles of beer, take one down, pass it 
  around, #{num_bottles - 1} bottles of beer on the wall!"

  num_bottles = num_bottles - 1
end 
                </code></pre>
                <p><strong>#{num_bottles}</strong> is an example of <strong>string interpolation</strong></p>

                <h3>Each loops</h3>
                <p>The most commonly used type of loop in Ruby is an each loop. It uses the <strong>.each</strong> method to iterate over a collection of elements, doing work to each one.</p>

                <p>First, we need a collection. Let's use a <strong>range</strong> of numbers to loop over.</p>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
(0..5).each do |number|
  puts "Value of number is #{number}"
end
                </code></pre>
                
            </section> 

            <section>
                <h3>Each loops</h3>
                <pre><code  class="ruby">
(0..5).each do |number|
  puts "Value of number is #{number}"
end
                </code></pre>
                <p>The loop has three parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The collection that will be looped through, in this case a range- '(0..5)'</li>
                    <li>The name to give each element when the loop begins again - 'number' - between the pipes | | </li>
                    <li>The code to execute with the element - puts line</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>We will revisit the each loop when we have a better understanding of collections.</p>

            <p>Ranges are simply the range of values between the given first and last elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Inclusive</strong> ranges have two dots, and include the last element. <strong>Exclusive</strong> ranges have three dots, and do not include the last element.</p>
            <p>Ranges need to be defined from lowest value to highest.</p>

new_hash["d"]             # returns 12, the value of this key
grades_hash.first         # returns a key/value pair
